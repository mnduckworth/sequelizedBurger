# sequelizedBurger

In sequelizedBurger, for the back-end portion, I used express.js for the server and routing, seuquelize ORM to create and handle the tables in the MySQL database, and javascript as the programming language.

For the front-end portion of the assignment I used handlebars.js to take a basic HTML template display data from my database.

The folder structure was organized using MVC (Model View Control).
